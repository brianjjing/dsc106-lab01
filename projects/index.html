    <h3>POWERCOACH üèãÔ∏è</h3>
    <p>My current and most long-term project. POWERCOACH is a real-time powerlifting form feedback, built using Flask-SocketIO and Mediapipe for the backend, SwiftUI for the frontend, and websockets to connect them. Just set up your camera in front of you, lift, and see and hear form critiques from your POWERCOACH! I plan to launch the app on on the App Store, with support for 15 weightlifting exercises including the 3 big powerlifting movements (squat, bench, deadlift).</p>

    <h3>CMI Behavior Detection with Sensor Data üëã</h3>
    <p>I was holding off participating in a Kaggle competition for the longest time, and so this is a side project I am currently doing. I am currently participating in the Child Mind Institute (CMI) behavior detection with sensor data competition, in which I am classifying body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) from non-BFRB everyday gestures, in a dataset of over 570,000 gestures. I will post the link to my submission to the competition after it is finalized and public.</p>

    <h3>AI Tuberculosis Detector ü¶†</h3>
    <p>Throughout high school, I was heavily inspired by the possibilities of computer vision and eventually decided to embark on a project that involved image processing. Using OpenCV and Tensorflow + Keras, I trained a sequential convolutional neural network to detect tuberculosis in chest X-rays, with 98% testing accuracy on over 4,200 images after optimizing the hyperparameters.</p>

    <h3>Diabetes Predictor ü©∏</h3>
    <p>After my Alzheimer's diagnosis model, I was inspired by the real-world impact data science had in potentially saving lives. Following the ICS program, I used my newfound data science knowledge to predict yet another deadly disease: hepatitis. This time, I switched to Python, conducting extensive EDA, as well as optimizing sklearn's LASSO and NaiveBayes models in my pipeline, on a dataset of over 230,000 patients.</p>

    <h3>Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis Model üß†</h3>
    <p>The project that started it all - this was my first full end-to-end data science pipeline ever. As part of UC Irvine's 2023 Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) Summer Academy, I, along with a team of 6 others, developed a multinomial LASSO regression model and a random forest classification model to detect Alzheimer‚Äôs from medical records using R. We also used SMOTE for class balancing and ggplot2 for EDA beforehand. We ended up diagnosing a dataset of 2,700 Alzheimer's patients with 90% accuracy, presenting the model to ICS parents and UCI CS staff.</p>
